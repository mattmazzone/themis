# Themis - Text to HTML/PDF Converter

Themis's purpose is to intake unformatted and unpredictable work order text files and to convert them into 
interactive HTML forms. The HTML forms can be filled out and saved locally or on a remote file server as PDF files.

Themis is based entirely on an object oriented architecture for modularity and maintainability.  
With built-in exception handling and error warnings, Themis is very reliable.

Themis will be used to convert over 2300 airplane engine maintenance work orders to interactive HTML forms.
