# Project Themis - Text to HTML/PDF Converter

A robust text parser built in C++.

Themis's purpous is to intake unformatted and unpredictable work order text files and to convert them into 
interactive HTML forms. The HTML forms can be filled out and saved locally or on a remote file server as PDF files.

Themis is based entirely on an Object Oriented architecture for modularity and maintainability.  
With built in exception handling and error warning, Themis has a very high success rate.

Themis was used to convert over 2300 work orders and the HTML forms are actively being used everyday
to store Airplane engine maintenance reports.
